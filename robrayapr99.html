Saddled with a cheesy teen-idol past and kiss-of-death UK
superstardom, manic pop thrill Robbie Williams is bent on taking
America nonetheless.<font color="#000000" size="3" face="arial narrow"> <br>

Robbie
Williams has faced a lot of obstacles in his decade-long career.
More than he cares to recall. As a former teen heartthrob from
fluffy UK chart sensations Take That, Robbie reckons he&#146;s
endured four career phases: &#147;I was in a boy band, then I was
sh**, then I was a clown, then I was successful, then I was
credible.&#148; The soft-spoken 24-year-old, having lived all of
his post-pubescent life in the British tabloids, was already a
survivor of multiple substance abuses before launching a solo
career that has slowly returned him to fame, at a price.
&#147;Blokes basically just walk up to me and go
&#145;Cunt!&#146; Getting off trains: &#145;Cunt! Walking down
the street: &#145;Cunt!&#146; That&#146;s painful. I&#146;m like,
&#145;Why am I a cunt? I am <i>not</i> a cunt!&#146;&#148;<br>
<br>
Williams--all tracksuit casual and impish giggles--is lounging
poolside at Los Angeles&#146; posh Sunset Marquis Hotel.
He&#146;s flown in to industry-show-case songs from <i>The Ego
Has Landed</i> a Capitol-licensed compendium of his two British
solo albums. This very afternoon, California has provided his
hugest hirdle yet, in the form of two scantily clad, porn-star
models dubbed Blondage. The situation is in hand when the
gorgeous girls pose beside Williams, sipping a crotch-mounted
margarita from his purple Speedos. The situation is still in hand
when he wades into the hotel pool, with Blondage slithering up
and down the handrail above his head. Then: disaster. The photo
shoot switches to a bubble jacuzzi, Williams doffs his trunks,
and the babes inch closer. Before the pop star knows it, he
blushes, &#147;I had a steamin&#146; hard-on in that Jacuzzi, and
it <i>really</i> got in the way.&#148; Did the models notice?
&#147;Yeah!&#148; Williams beams. &#147;They were rubbing
themselves against it--<i>sooooo</i> naughty!&#148;<br>
<br>
To a casual onlooker, the satirically decadent photo session
paints Williams as something of a sexist pig, happy to abuse the
women around him. Talk to the guy and the picture changes.
Robbie, son of a Stoke-On-Trent comedian and pub owner, is still
a big goofy kid basking in all his hard-(w)on glory. His second
solo disc, <i>I&#146;ve Been Expecting You</i>, has sold over
four million copies. Last year, he headlined the Glastonbury
festival&#146;s largest crowd ever. His latest single, the
trend-humping &#147;Millenium&#148; topped the charts. He
regularly hobnobs with Britpop royalty(such as members of Pulp,
Blur and the Bluetones, not to mention Tom Jones and Sir Bono) at
snooty after-hours rookeries like the Groucho Club and the Soho
house. (Entree into London pop society wasn&#146;t too difficult
for the lad: &#147;You take some drugs and make people laugh--or
drink a whole lot,&#148; he chuckles, &#147;and you&#146;re
inducted no matter who you are.&#148;) He&#146;s dated an All
Saint and consorted with Spice Girls. And, asked by Prince
Charles at his birthday show what Robbie had canceled to make the
appearance, Williams replied, &#147;Nothing, apart from world
domination.&#148;<br>
<br>
Not that the performer, whose onstage persona is somewhere
between Elton John on speed and Henry Rollins with a singing
voice, doesn&#146;t still have a lot to answer for. &#147;I <i>hated</i>
Take That toward the end,&#148; he grouses. &#147;That level of
obsession and fanaticism just scared the living daylights out of
me.&#148; Examples of such obsession include two Finnish girls
who stalked him around his hometown and, after being snubbed,
enacted revenge by urinating on his driveway; a German bus
company which showed up every Thursday at half past three
(&#147;They&#146;d get off the bus, 53 of &#145;em, and run
through my gardens and nick patches of grass&#148;); and
don&#146;t even get him started on the groupie that made it her
life&#146;s mission to deflower the fellow at the tender age of
16. &#147;Basically you&#146;re not you when you&#146;re onstage,
you&#146;re not you when you&#146;re in public,&#148; says
Williams. &#147;You put on a persona, and all these people were
really in love with this persona, which wasn&#146;t me.&#148;<br>
<br>
Now--with the help of co-writer/keyboardist Guy
Chambers--Williams swears he&#146;s found himself. He knows
it&#146;s an uphill battle in the States, but things have been
looking up during this warm LA sortie, which included demo pants
off an invite-only crowd with self-effacing asides and solid
tunes, and to top it off, this little romp. Sure, his libido ran
wild with Blondage, he sighs. &#147;I&#146;m 24--it&#146;s <i>allowed</i>
to!&#148; And he already has big plans for the rac negatives:
Those are gonna make some <i>great</i> Christmas cards, maybe
with a little pop-up penis in the middle that says &#145;Welcome
to Stoke-On-Trent! I hope you enjoy your stay!&#146;&#148; <br>
