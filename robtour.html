Rob been taking a break at home in London.  He did not appear on Saturday Night Live or the VH1 Fashion
Awards, as far as I know, but Leno was excellent!!!  He is performing at two shows in the states: <font color="#69AC2D" size="4" face="Arial Narrow">
The Spectrum First Union Corp Center on December 14, 1999 in Philadephia, PA and KIIS FM Jungle Jam at Knotts Berry Farm in Los Angeles, CA on December 17, 1999.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Narrow">
I am just a little upset here!  <font color="#69AC2D" size="4" face="Arial Narrow">Rob is reportedly frustrated with America</font> and I don't blame him!
Supposedly a body double was used in the new U.S. video for Angels because Rob was too "fat."  Since
the beginning he has been marketed as an "ex-boyband member" appealing to the Backstreet Boys, teen crowd when
 he has a more original and larger appeal.  His past club tour was did not do as well as hoped and EMI has not officially released
Angels!  What can be done about this?  Well, I think Rob needs a bit of
encouragement for one.  Go <a href="http://www.mtv.com/mtv/tubescan/trl99_new"> here </a> <font color="#69AC2D" size="4" face="Arial Narrow"> to vote for Angels
on MTV's Total Request Live.</font>

Rob is hanging around the states again.  Angels has been released and isn't getting played as
much as I would prefer.  Rob is going to be <font color="#69AC2D" size="4" face="Arial Narrow">on Jay Leno
November 3.</font>  More upcoming VCR dates would be <font color="#69AC2D" size="4" face="Arial Narrow">Saturday Night Live on November 27 and
the VH1 Fashion Awards on December 3. </font> I don't mean to whine, but this is my niche in cyberspace.  Why isn't
Rob playing any West Coast gigs?!!  This is driving me crazy!<br><br><br>

Whoa!  What happened here?  there's a big lapse in time, I know.  I apologize, but I went through a
big move and then moved this site around.  It looks much better now, don't you think?
<br><Br>
So what is new with Rob?  His American club tour is over.  Click <a href="http://members.xoom.com/dazzagirl/robnews.htm">
here</a> for the latest diary dates.  I got to see two of Rob's shows, the S.F. and L.A. ones. Did you want
to see a couple of <font color="#69AC2D" size="4" face="Arial Narrow">pictures from the L.A. show? Click <a href="robpics.html">here</a>.</font>
 The next single in America is supposed to be Angels, that's the buzz.  But <font color="#69AC2D" size="4" face="Arial Narrow">MTV is currently showing
 the video for Let Me Entertain You </font> and also his <font color="#69AC2D" size="4" face="Arial Narrow">
performance of Angels at the Glastonbury Festival in '98.</font>  Try late night/early morning to catch them.

Standings and album sales<font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"
face="Arial Narrow">as of May 13, 1999: He's only sold 18,800
albums (not that great so far) and will be ranked #85 on
Billboard. At my local Tower Records, he's #12 in sales. That was
pleasantly surprising. But I'm not worried. I believe his sales
will pick up with the release of other singles (like Angels!). <br>

color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Narrow">This is the first
time I have ever really <i>seen</i> Rob interviewed, but he was
hilarious! He was very excited, and definitely a bit nervous too.
He sang Millenium, of course, changing it up a little in the
bridge to say &quot;Dave Letterman&quot; instead of
&quot;Millenium.&quot; He was rumored to be on Saturday Night
Live sometime this month, but since the season is soon ending, it
looks unlikely.<br>

Francisco yesterday on the radio live!<font
color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Narrow"> I guess he and his
band performed two songs acousticly along with an interview.
Unfortunately, I don't live within receiving signals and missed
this. A friend who is unfamiliar with Robbie said that he came
off kind of &quot;weird.&quot; He was making a lot of cracks at
himself, which is normal for Rob, but my friend didn't know what
to make of it. I assume other listeners unfamiliar with him might
have the same reaction. Hmmmm.... </font><br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Narrow">Has anyone out
there heard any other radio appearances by Robbie in the states?
I know he did one with Mancow in Chicago a few weeks back. <a
