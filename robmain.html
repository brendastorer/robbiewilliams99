<br><br>My focus in this site is to promote Rob's U.S.
endeavor. It is for new fans to check out what this guy is all
about, and also for overseas fans to keep up with his career over
here.  I discovered Rob while living in Europe in '97 and '98 and have been following
him since the beginning of his career in America.
If you have any comments or suggestions, I would love them so
please <a href=mailto:schnazzy@hotmail.com>email me.</a>

<br>
I will be moving to London in a month and so I don't really know what to do with this website!!  I
might be moving this site to a free website for prosperity, but enjoy it for now.
<br><br>
If you are
curious about me, the creator of this site, check me out <a
href="index.html">here.</a>
<!--So sad I lost the about me page -->
<br>
<br>
But, I assume
you are probably more curious about Rob! Follow the menu below to find out
more about him! <br>

<!-- I cannot find the gif for the image map below, so in order to still be able to navigate the site in 2014, I replaced this image map with the text links below. I have no recollection what that image may have looked like. I do remember that I mapped out these coordinates all by myself and was terribly proud of that. I also lost the "robhist.html" file so I removed that link. -->
