dreams Ricky Martin and Robbie Williams are all grown up and
ready to play in the big leagues. So take that, America. <br>

U.K. bad boy Robbie Williams also feels the pain (referring to a
prior mentioning of one of Ricky Martin's ballad where he
sings,&quot;So much time, so much pain.&quot;) though he has a
different solution: &quot;Life's too short to be afraid/So take a
pill to numb the pain.&quot; Williams knows that great pop starts
are made of strong personae as much as memorable music. So, on
his U.S. debut, <i>The Ego Has Landed</i>, he presents himself as
a loveable lout. He commits blasphemy (&quot;I hope I live to see
the day the Pope gets high&quot; in &quot;Old Before I
Die&quot;), compares himself to Kiss &quot;without the
makeup&quot; when he arises (&quot;Strong&quot;), and babbles
freely about his sef-indulgences that you'll feel like you're at
a group-therapy session for Oasis. <br>
<br>
Those attributes alone would make Williams stand out, but the
anthemic splendor of <i>The Ego Has Landed</i> (culled from his
to U.K. albums) is more shocking than any of his drug references.
Like <i>Ricky Martin</i>, the album touches on everything from
the grandest of sky-high ballads (&quot;Angels&quot;
&quot;Strong&quot;) to alternative bubblegum
(&quot;Millenium&quot;) to grotty corpprate rock (&quot;Win Some,
Lose Some&quot;). But Williams feisty personality and the
cranked-to-11 energy of his band hold everything together. And
who would have thought that a highlight would be the sublime and
sophisticated &quot;No Regrets,&quot; which has the shimmer and
wit of the Pet Shop Boys (and their Neil Tennant on harmonies to
boot)? Williams and company stumble when they attempt over-baked
glam. But for the most part, Williams is the drinking man's
George Michael, and, bless his crude heart, he'll never let you
forget it. Grade given=A- (Ricky Martin's album received a B-)<br>
