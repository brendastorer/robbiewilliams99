Williams: From the Top of the Pops to the Bottom of the Barrel
and Back Again <br>

<br>
<font color="#000000" size="3" face="arial narrow">If the
throng of girls I&#146;m scrambling past knew what had just
happened, they&#146;d tear me limb from limb--or at least leave
me standing in the streets of Dublin in my boxers. Just minutes
ago, pop sensation Robbie Williams presented me with a special
gift: his pants, simply because the color, bright orange, matched
my hair. <br>
<br>
Who could blame these lasses if they set upon me violently?
They&#146;ve huddled in the cold drizzle all day, waiting for a
glimpse of Williams exiting the hotel. Meanwhile, he&#146;s been
strutting around in his Calvins solely for my amusement. (If
it&#146;s any consolation ladies, I&#146;ve dreamed of Williams
dropping his trousers for longer than I care to admit.) You say
you&#146;ve never heard of this guy? Well, if you&#146;re not a
big fag, an ardent British-music devotee or a very savvy teenage
girl, theoversight is excusable for a few weeks more--until
Williams officially launches his assault of on America.<br>
<br>
In England, Williams has released two number-one albums: the
quintuple-platinum <i>Life Thru A Lens</i> and last year&#146;s
follow-up, <i>I&#146;ve Been Expecting You</i>. (His American
debut, <i>The Ego Has Landed</i>, on Capitol records, culls cuts
from both.) His single &#147;Angels&#148; ruled the British Top
Ten during the 1997 Christmas season, and MTV Europe crowned him
Best Male Perfomer last year. And that&#146;s all since leaving
Take That, the celebrated boy band with whom he sold over two
million albums and racked up eight number-one hits. His split
from the group in 1995 heralded the demise of one of
Europe&#146;s biggest pop acts. <br>
<br>
The extraordinary aspect of his story, however, isn&#146;t the
dizzying height to which Williams has climbed. What&#146;s
remarkable is how many times he&#146;s fallen on his face,
literally and figuratively, along the way. For one thing, before
the success of &#147;Angels&#148; resuscitated sales, Life Thru a
Lens had moved barely 40,000 units. He had released three other
singles prior to that, each greeted with an increasingly
lackluster reception, and his consumption of drugs, alcohol, and
food raged unchecked. In photos, he constantly appeared bloated,
over-weight, exhausted. The press had a field day at every ugly
turn.<br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="5" face="arial narrow">Cocky But
Sincere</font><br>
Williams loves his mother; he wrote the tender, &#147;One of
God&#146;s Better People&#148; in her honor. But if Jan Williams
ever scolded her son not to play with his food, he&#146;s
forgotten. Right now, he&#146;s flinging pieces of sashimi across
the hotel suite into his buddy Jonathan Wilkes&#146; open mouth,
like a trainer feeding a seal. An interview with the 25-year-old
star resemples nothing so closely as hanging with
Winnie-the-Pooh&#146;s spastic pal Tigger. The singer pauses to
offer me a take-out tin of raw fish, the same one he&#146;s been
tappin his cigarette ashes into. &#147;Would you like some
salmon?&#148; he asks, straight-faced. &#147;It&#146;s
smoked.&#148;<br>
<br>
The adrenaline from last night&#146;s sold-out gig hasn&#146;t
subsided. &#147;We did a two-hour show,&#147; Williams proclaims.
&#147;I didn&#146;t want to get offstage.&#148; This evening,
he&#146;ll play even longer, climaxing with unrehearsed encores
of the Clash&#146;s &#147;Should I Stay or Should I Go?&#148; and
Primal Scream&#146;s &#147;Rocks,&#148; then announce that
it&#146;s been the best set of his life. Yesterday&#146;s show
also featured another landmark. &#147;I had my first big strop
last night too. Do you know what that means?&#148; he asks. I say
no and Williams suddenly screams, &#147;Where&#146;s my fucking
coat?&#148; as I recoil. He smirks, dusting off his hands.
&#147;That&#146;s a strop.&#148; It seems the prop he&#146;s
required for a comedy bit hadn&#146;t been ready. &#147;I&#146;ve
never shouted like that before,&#148; he says. &#147;I even
scared myself. Now that I&#146;m playing in arenas and loads of
people like me, I&#146;m going to be mean to them.&#148;<br>
<br>
Not bloody likely. Though he possesses a viscious wit, Williams
is exeptionally good natured. At our first, accidental meeting,
he extends his hand and announces, &#147;Hi, I&#146;m Rob,&#148;
in regular-guy fashion, without any prompting from his handlers.
There&#146;s an Everyman quality about him. Taxi drivers in
Dublin all speak highly of him this weekend. Palpable sincerity
underscores Williams&#146; enthousiastic delivery, his cocky
disposition offset with exuberence. His hit &#147;Let Me
Entertian You&#148; captures this ceaseless need to amuse in a
video that showcases him strutting about in Kiss drag. This is
exactly the sort of good old fashioned showbiz pizzazz that
American rock desperately needs today. &#147;Shoe-gazing and
being serious and slashing your wrists is all right,&#148; he
shrugs, &#147;if you like that sort of stuff.&#148;<br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="5" face="arial narrow">Man or
Party Machine<br>
</font>Williams
didn&#146;t make the transition from teen idol to credible artist
smoothly. Extricating himself from contractual ties to Take That
demanded time and money and prohibited him from recording for a
year. Although he needed time to regroup, he couldn&#146;t stay
out of the public eye. &#147;I&#146;d worked nonstop: seven days
a week for six years,&#148; he says. It seemed only natural to
continue the breakneck pace. He filled the void with stints as a
TV presenter, talk show guest and a general rabble-rouser.
&#147;I said, f*** work, I&#146;ll move to London and drink a
lot,&#148; he recalls. He became a fixture on the celebrity pop
circuit. &#147;In Take That, we weren&#146;t allowed to go out to
these sort of places,&#148; he explains. &#147;And to my expense,
a shrinking bank balance and rehab later, I found out why.&#148;<br>
<br>
It&#146;s a tribute to the lad&#146;s stanima that he maintained
the debaunchery as long as he did. In his concerts nowadays, a
montage of exploding Jack Daniel&#146;s bottles and humiliating
tabloid headlines flashes onscreen during &#147;Man
Machine,&#148; which commemorates his downhill slide.
&#147;Waking up at 2 o&#146;clock in the morning and going out to
start the night for the next day was normal,&#148; Williams says.
He&#146;d call a cab, hit the clubs and start shoveling coke up
his nose.<br>
<br>
Williams&#146;s new record company wasn&#146;t amused.
Overexposure was eroding its acquisition&#146;s charisma, and
Williams had produced little music. His singing ability
wasn&#146;t in question--he&#146;s handled lead vocals on two
Take That hits--but songwriting wasn&#146;t proving so easy.
&#147;I knew that I could write poetry,&#148; he insists.
&#147;But I also knew that I only knew three chords, and the
combination of those chords can&#146;t last forever.&#148; Unless
you&#146;re the Ramones. &#147;or Oasis,&#148; he says, appearing
momentarily startled by his own tongue; the Gallagher brothers
are his friends. &#147;Meow,&#148; he muses, pursing his lips.
&#147;Put the knife back in the drawer, Ms. Sharp.&#148; <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="5" face="arial narrow">The View
From The Bottom<br>
</font>It&#146;s
no coincidence that Williams is kicking off his European tour in
Dublin. This is where he had the epiphany that eventually set him
back on course. He&#146;d come alone, he says, on a &#147;sad,
self-destructive mission&#148; during the 1996 Christmas
holidays. &#147;I got off the ferry and didn&#146;t even
unpack--just went straight to the pub,&#148; he says. &#147;Then
I wandered about aimlessly, drinking Guiness.&#148; Through the
haze, the pensive lyrics for &#147;Angels&#148; took shape. By
praying to be redeemed by a higher power, Williams discovered the
key to rescuing himself. &#147;I got back and the record company
went&#148;--he assumes a very stern tone--&#148;Here&#146;s a
sheet of people you&#146;re going to write with. Pick one!&#148;
Mercifully, his shotgun wedding to Guy Chambers (of World Party)
clicked. Their collaborations sparkled with the pop polish of
Williams&#146; past, but recast in the indie rock tradition of
Oasis, Blur, and Manic Street Preachers. <br>
<br>
Still, Williams recorded his first full-length album in a stupor.
He checked into rehab before the album hit the shelves, then
tackled the promotional trail clean and sober. (These days, the
singer isn&#146;t tee-total, but keeps his vices in check.) But
despite a reputation for loving the underdog, the British public
had tired of his antics. <br>
<br>
Rejection caught Williams off guard. He&#146;d gone straight from
school to Take That&#146;s protective cocoon of foame. Sales of
his first two singles, though hardly breathtaking, had proved
impressive. &#147;Then I released the album and,&#148; arcing his
hand sharply, he imitates an airplane plummeting to the ground.
People who&#146;d once cooed over his every quip wouldn&#146;t
deign the book to him on predawn chat shows. <br>
<br>
These days, thanks to the belated triumph of &#147;Angels&#148;
and the hits that followed--&#147;Let Me Entertain You,&#148;
&#147;Millenium&#148; and &#147;No Regrets&#148;--the shoe&#146;s
back on teh other foot. Williams says he learned a lot during his
exile in the trenches: &#147;Now when I can&#146;t do every
interview and people go, &#145;He used to be ever so nice, give
us everything we wanted,&#146; I say,&#146;If I wasn&#146;t so
fucking famous and selling lots of singles, you wouldn&#146;t
touch me with a barge pole.&#148;<br>
<br><font color="#55cb1d" size="5" face="arial narrow">
Earning Indie Cred</font><br>
One attribute that&#146;s never failed Williams is his refusal to
play his cards close to his chest. &#147;I expose all my
weaknesses, so nobody&#146;s got anything on me,&#148;he says.
Though he&#146;s uttered many unkind remards to his former band
and his ex-manager, Nigel-Martin Smith (inspiration for the
blistering song &#147;Karma Killer&#148;), he&#146;s rarely
recanted.<br>
<br>
Currently, the charts are clogged with prefab boy
bands--Backstreet Boys, &#145;N Sync, Boyzone--for which Take
That set the standard. Although Williams crosses paths with them
occasionally, members rarely approach him. &#147;Only with sexual
advances,&#148; he jokes. &#147;Originally, as soon as I&#146;d
left, they&#146;d ask me for advice.&#148; They stopped queuing
up when he checked into rehab.<br>
<br>
Williams moves in different circles now. He performed alongside
Tom Jones at last year&#146;s Brit Awards. The Pet Shop
Boys&#146; Neil Tennant and the Divine Comedy&#146;s Neil Hannon
sang on his recent smash &#147;No Regrets,&#148; and the latter
is serving as this tour&#146;s support act. &#147;I have to be
drunk just to speak to (Hannon), because I&#146;m so in awe of
his talent,&#148; Williams says. But the only person who
questions Williams&#146; crediblitynow is himslef. Damon Albarn
from Blur is his neighbor. When their paths cross, Williams
dissolves into a stuttering schoolgirl. &#147;Is this person
thinking I am a dick?&#148; he worries. The paranoia stems
partially from respect for Albarn&#146;s songwriting, but the
main culprit is the specter of William&#146;s past.
&#147;There&#146;s still that habit built-in reaction :
&#145;I&#146;. from a boy band, and you&#146;re immensibly
credible.&#146;&#148; During the making of <i>Life Thru A Lens</i>,
Guy Chambers had telephoned Sonya Madan of Echobelly and invited
her to sing on a track. She laughed and hung up on him.
&#147;I&#146;m not a musician,&#148; Williams says. The craft of
composition often feels foreign. &#147;I don&#146;t pretend to be
Marilyn Manson or Billy Corgan or Noel Gallagher. I don&#146;t
have <i>intistic artegrity</i>.&#148;<br>
<br>
You read that spoonerism right. Williams has dyslexia, which he
lampoons frequesntly. &#147;I&#146;m going to write a song
called, &#145;Just Because You;re Dyslexic Doesn&#146;t Mean
You&#146;re Not Thick,&#148; he announces. &#147;So many people
go, &#145;Oooh, can you check the bill out?&#146;or &#147;Can
somebody spell this for me? I&#146;m dyslexic.&#146; And because
it&#146;s the 90&#146;s and everybody&#146;s PC, it&#146;s
accepted.&#148;<br>
<br>
Political correctness puts Williams&#146; knickers in aknot,
primarily because it&#146;s ruined his favorite film franchise.
&#147;James Bond is shit since political correctness,&#148; he
laments. On the cover of <i>I&#146;ve Been Expecting You</i>,
Williams strokes a cat, one eyebrow cocked in a homage to the
secret agent. &#147;Millenium,&#148; his first U.S. single,
continues the trend, lifting a riff from &#147;You Only Live
Twice&#148; for the hook and showcasing the singer with a gaggle
of Bond beauties in the video. <br>
<br>
The Bond parallels point toward why this man stands to succeed in
America where other U.K. phenomena have fallen short. Like the
secret angent at his best, Robbie Williams is quintessentially
British in character yet international in appeal. Women want to
be loved by him and men would love to be him. <br>
<br>
A few would opt for both. While his Take That costume soften
resembled International Male castoffs and his turbulent romance
with All Saints&#146; Nicole Appleton looks like a classic beard
job, Williams is not gay. But he&#146;d be very good at it if he
were. By the end of our interview he has: a) extolled the
physical charms of Elvis Presley, short-lived Bond George Lazenby
and even Matt LeBlanc of <i>Friends</i> b) shouted, &#147;All
right, I&#146;m gay!&#148; and &#147;I&#146;d sleep with Tom
Jones&#148;; c) stripped down to his underwear; and d) kissed me
good-bye. <br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, Williams&#146; combustible character has
confounded some critics in the build-&#146;em-up,
knock-&#146;em-down U.K. media. Much of the praise he receives is
backhanded. &#147;They say that I&#146;m &#145;humbly
arrogant,&#146;&#148; he claims. &#147;you know Prince Naseem
(Hamed), the boxer? He&#146;s never been beat. He makes
predictions about what round he&#146;s gonna knock people out in.
And he&#146;s accused of being ultimately arrogant because, he
says, &#145;I&#146;m the greatest Nobody&#146;s going to beat
me.&#146; Sometimes I get accused of the same thing. But if you
don&#146;t think that you are the greatest at what you do,
you&#146;re going ot get beated up. If I don&#146;t become the
very best entertainer, I&#146;m going to fall.&#148; <br>
<br>
After a decade in training, Robbie Williams is ready to square
off with America. But first, he&#146;s going to fetch a change of
pants. <br>
