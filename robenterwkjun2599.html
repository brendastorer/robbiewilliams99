AGE</font> 25. 
<font face="arial narrow" color="#55cb1d" size=3>WHY HIM?</font>
A supernova in his
native England, this former Take That singer scores big with his
anthem-packed U.S. debut, <i>The Ego Has Landed</i>, a winning
mix of cheeky humor and pop songcraft. <font face="arial narrow" color="#55cb1d" size=3>
WORK HABITS</font> &quot;My worst habits?
Oh, <i>work habits (sounding dissapointed)</i>. There's no real
habits. We write them whenever we can. We do it at the back of
the buses or at radio stations or at festivals like the one I'm
at today.&quot; <font face="arial narrow" color="#55cb1d" size=3>
CAN'T WORK WITHOUT </font>&quot;A monkey in a tiara. There always
has to be a monkey in a tiara cracking the whip.&quot; <font face="arial narrow" color="#55cb1d" size=3>
 WORST JOB </font> &quot;I used to go
knock on people's doors and say, 'Hello, I'm from a window
company. Is this your house? Would you like to have some windows
put in?' That was my job.&quot; <font face="arial narrow" color="#55cb1d" size=3>
WHO'D STAR IN HIS BIOPIC?</font> &quot;Jesse from
MTV.&quot; <font face="arial narrow" color="#55cb1d" size=3>
IF HE COULDN'T SING HE'D... </font>&quot;I <i>can't</i> sing and I'm still doing
this.&quot; <font face="arial narrow" color="#55cb1d" size=3>RECURRING
DREAM </font>&quot;I
had a dream the other night that me mum doused herself in petrol
and set herself on fire. That's hardcore. I don't have nice
dreams, I have nightmares.&quot; <font face="arial narrow" color="#55cb1d" size=3> 
ADVICE HE WISHES HE'D GOTTEN SOONER </font>
&quot;Keep your clothes
on.&quot; <font face="arial narrow" color="#55cb1d" size=3> AUSTIN
POWERS OR DR.EVIL? </font>&quot;Austin Powers. Yeah, baby! Because he says <i>shag</i>
a lot.&quot; <font face="arial narrow" color="#55cb1d" size=3>
WANTS TO WORK WITH </font>
&quot;Everybody I want to work with is
dead. Like Winston Churchill. I'd get him to come and talk over
one of my tracks.&quot; <font face="arial narrow" color="#55cb1d" size=3>
 NEXT?</font> Currently performing in Europe, Williams will
tour the U.S. this fall. <br>
