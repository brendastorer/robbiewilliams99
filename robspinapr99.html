LOS
ANGELES--Robbie Williams is standing in a Jacuzzi at the West
Hollywood Sunset Marquis Hotel, his crimson Speedo floating
several feet away, fluffing his semi-flacid member into
consciousness. This is partly for the amusement of his band
members, who are sprawled nearby on pool chairs sipping tea, and
partly to increase his self-esteem around the two porn starts who
will join him momentarily in the Jacuzzi for a magazine photo
shoot. <br>
<br>
Earlier today, it was announced the the 25-year old Williams,
Britian's multi-platinum clown prince of pop, has been nominated
for six Brit Awards--the U.K. equivalent of the Grammys. It's
definitive proof of the pan-generational appeal of the former
Take That member once dismissed as an unstable,
substance-abusing, former-teenybop plaything. Now Capitol
Records, which signed Williams last year, is embarking on a full
blown campaign to introduce him, and his debut album, &quot;The
Ego has Landed,&quot; to an unsuspecting American public. Later
tonight, Williams will play a showcase for the Capitol minions
and a selection of L.A. media types thought to be sympathetic to
his cause. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not going to have a soft-on in front of all these
girls!&quot; Williams shouts. &quot;Come on, little Robbie. Don't
fail me now!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Robbie, hide your sac!&quot; commands the photographer. In
retort, Williams yanks his dick between his thighs, stopping
short of trying to plug it up his behind. As he flails around in
the water, Michelle, a model-slash-actress he hooked up with in a
bar two days previously, turns up poolside. (&quot;She just
thought I was a nice, funny guy. It wasn't until we went out that
I told her, 'By the way, I've sold four million records.'&quot;)
Williams pulls on his Speedo backwards and greets her warmly, one
testicle drooping out of his trunks. Michelle avers her eyes, a
position she will maintain for the next two hours as Williams
mugs tirelessly for the camera while flanked by Vivid Video vets
Janine Lindemulder and Julia Ann, known to their fans as
&quot;Blondage.&quot; The women wrap their thighs around
William's neck and proffer their breasts for his gratified
inspection. After the session, Williams politely shakes hands
with the still-naked actresses and says, &quot;Pleasure working
with you.&quot; <br>
<br>
Back in his hotel room, the message light is blinking. Williams
hits the speakerphone. &quot;Hello, Robbie, Elton here.
Congratulations on the nominations. I'm really happy for you.
We've got to get together soon. Bye, darling.&quot; Surprised and
touched by the message and undoubtedly gratified that the press
in the room have just received impormptu confirmation of his
status as a member of Britian's pop aristocracy, Williams
slumpsdown on a couch for a pre-showcase nap. As MTV lulls him to
sleep, Korn's &quot;Got the Life&quot; video is playing on Total
Request Live. &quot;Is this what I'm going to have to do to make
it in America?&quot; he signs. The Backstreet Boys are up next.
Williams pronounces them &quot;the best boy band ever.&quot; 98
degrees, however are not so fortunate. &quot;Look at them. How
can you ever cross over from that?&quot; he snorts, meaning,
&quot;How can you ever hope to graduate from being just another
assembly line boy band to being a magnetic and controversial pop
celebrity like me.&quot; He says this with more pity than malice.
His eyes slide shut midway through their song. <br>
<br>
At his showcase in the tiny North Hollywood club Lucky Seven,
Williams makes it playing that he's more Vegas act than rock
dude. Vamping his way through the Bond-theme-esque
&quot;Millenium&quot; and the epic ballad &quot;Angels,&quot; he
winks and waves at crowd members, tosses the mic in the air, and
busts out the time honered Elvis karate-stance. &quot;People over
here hear my accent and ask me about the Sex Pistols and the
Clash,&quot; Williams tells the audience, &quot;I don't know shit
about any of that. Frank Sinatra's my hero. Dean Martin, Sammy
Davis, Jr., Nat Kind Cole--everyone I love is American. Apart
from my mum. And I heard she's had some American in her. Thank
god she's 6,000 miles away. No, but I love my mum....&quot; <br>
<br>
The crowd laps it up. Admittedly, the Capitol audience quotient
would give Williams a rousing ovation if he correctly pronounced
the word, &quot;green,&quot; but, in this instance, his
self-mocking performance is winning enough to merit their
enthousiasm. He even manages to assault a couple of tear ducts by
dedicating a new song, &quot;It's Hurting Me, Too&quot; to
&quot;someone who broke up with me over Christmas,&quot; an
oblique reference to his on-again-off-again fiancee, All Saints'
Nicole Appleton. Date du jour Michelle, who is sitting in the
audience, once again adverts her eyes. <br>
<br>
After the show, Capitol honcho Roy Lott says, &quot;I feel very
positive about having success with Robbie in the States. The
challenge is, because he's so special, we have to make sure
everyone understands his uniqueness.&quot; This may be more of a
challenge than Lott realizes. After Williams has left the stage,
a passing journalist with narrow-to-nonexistent terms of
reference mutters, &quot;I don't know, you've already got
Everlast doing that kind of thing....&quot; <br>
<br>
The next day, as Williams checks out of the hotel, he declares
the pampered anonymity of his L.A. stopover &quot;the most
relaxing time I've had since I've been famous.&quot; But don't
expect Britian's biggest pop star to go too long without working.
When the desk clerk hands him yet another congratulatory fax
about his Brit nomination clean-sweep, Williams spreads his arms
wide and, attracting the notice to the entire lobby, announces,
&quot;It's official, I'm gay!&quot; <br>
