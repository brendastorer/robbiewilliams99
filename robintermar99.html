Rip-Roaring Robbie Williams <br>
<br><font face="arial narrow" font color="#55cb1d" size="5">
Robbie Williams swears he can't sing--or maybe that's just part
of his vaudeville act. The flamboyant singer has risen from the
ashes of Take That to become the darling of British pop.<font

<br>
Interview by Ray Rogers. Click <a href="robpics.html">here</a> for photos from the
interview. <br>
<br>
<font color="#000000" size="3" face="arial narrow">Is Robbie
Williams pop's new poster boy or just another rock 'n' roll
swindle? Perhaps both. By his own admission, the former Take That
vocalist is talent-impaired on the musical front. But when it
comes to showmanship, his wild card antics have given him a
winning hand. Having swept the year-end polls in Britian--he
scored a record six Brit Award nominations--and throughout
Europe, where he was named MTV's best male performer, the
twenty-five-year-old winking prankster from the industrial town
of Stoke-on-Trent is setting his sights on American soil. His
U.S. debut, a combination or his two multiplatinum U.K. albums,
is due out in May. Its smartly self-conscious pop songs could
well reach fans of all of the boys: Pet Shop, Backstreet, maybe
even the Beasties. <br>
<br>
It's the first time Williams will be introduced to American
audiences. By the time his former group Take That had its first
and only U.S. hit, &quot;Back for Good,&quot; Williams had
already been booted from the fresh-scrubbed teen act for his
rebelliousness. Rather than play the role of the boy next door,
Williams was more of the juvenile delinqent down the street: His
substance abuse and romantic shenanigans became constant fodder
for the London tabloids. <br>
<br>
After focusing his energy and emerging as a solo artist, Williams
recaptured public attention as the endearingly naughty boy or
Britpop. And while he doesn't take himself seriously, he has
gotten the stamp of approval from adoring pop fans, not to
mention the rock 'n' roll set (he parties with the likes of Oasis
and Metallica), the old-timers (his hip-shaking duet with Tom
Jones on a British awards ceremony was a showstopper), and some
of Britian's most celebrated songwriters--Neil Tennant of the Pet
Shop Boys and Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy collaberated with
Williams on &quot;No Regrets,&quot; a bitterweet song about his
breakup with Take That. Can he conquer the rest of the world
next? Ready or not, here he comes. <br>
<br>
RAY ROGERS: Hello, Robbie. How are you? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">ROBBIE
WILLIAMS: I'm good. I'm sat right next to a pool. Is this called
a cabana? I'm in a cabana, and a shag long--a chaise lounge. </font><br>
<br>
RR: Congratulations on your nominations. <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Thank
you very much. I've been nominated for six things, I don't know
what they are. I think it's everything apart from female. That
will be next year; we're working on it. I'm thinking of having a
sex change. I keep winning all the best male categories. It's
getting boring now, so what I'm gonna do is just have the snip.
Me and Alan Morissette--she's gonna go male next year. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Can you
recall the first show you ever put on, or when you realized you
were meant to perform? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Me mum
tells this story about when I was three and we were on holiday in
Spain and she lost me. She was worried and she went around the
hotel looking for me. She eventually found me and I'd entered
myself into a competition. I came on-stage singing &quot;Summer
Nights&quot; from <i>Grease</i> as John Travolta. That's when she
first realized that I was gonna do something. After that I got a
hat; I passed it around the pool and started singing for potato
chips. </font><br>
<br>
RR: And that's at age three? Are you putting me on? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: No, no,
I'm not. For two years I did nothing at all. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: When
you were in Take That, was being a pop star the goal, or were you
interested in being taken seriously musically? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW:
(laughs) I was never gonna be taken seriously in Take That. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: I mean,
for you, inside, did you want to be taken seriously? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: No. To
tell you the honest truth I got into music by mistake, completely
and utterly by mistake. I started acting when I was eight--I did
a lot of theater. My mother wanted me to go to college but I
wanted to be an actor. When my exam results came though I was
just sh***ing myself because my mother was going to throw me out
of the house. So I auditioned for everything I could--every TV
and theater thing that came up--and one of these auditions was
for a band called Take That. So, now I've got the most
interesting hobby anybody could ever have, but I'm an actor,
really. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Is
being a pop star really about acting? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Oh,
most definitely. And I'm getting away with it, which is the
funniest thing. I really can't sing. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: You
don't think so? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: No, not
really. I'm just having a whale of a time. For somebody who
doesn't really sing--just writes a few lyrics and sings a few
melodies--I've sold four million albums. That's the biggest laugh
of the last decade. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Do you
think the line from your song &quot;Millenium&quot;--&quot;Get up
and see the sarcasm in my eyes&quot;--helps to explain why so
many people are relating to what you're doing? That they get the
sarcasm? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I'd
like to think so, that they can see the sarcasm in my eyes, but I
think why people get into it so much is so many poeple these days
are taking themselves ultra, ultra seriously. That's great if
you're the sort of band that lives and dies for music--&quot;This
is what I do and it's my art.&quot; That's fine. But I have a
laugh, and I think people relate to that. People might be sick of
seeing somebody taking themselves so bloody seriously; they want
to see somebody make an idiot of themselves, and that's me. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: How far
do you think you can take that, though? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Well, I
tried to wear a dress last year and that didn't work. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: So
what's next? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I don't
know really. Donkey sex? <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Do you
want to grow as a musician or a lyricist, or is it all about
entertainment? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: It is
all about entertainment, but I love it when people come up to me
and say, &quot;I really like the lyric in that song, it's very
clever.&quot; That doesn't mean I want to mature as a musician;
that means my hobby makes me money and people like it. It's like
collecting the best stamps in the world and people who are into
that come up to you and go, &quot;That's a really nice stamp. I
wish I'd got it.&quot; <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Do you
think you'll stick with music or would you like ot cross over
into more straight-ahead acting? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I'm
writing a film at the minute, which I'm very excited about, and
I'm writing a book. The basic thing is, I've got a name now and
with that name I can go off and do other things. If I hadn't got
a name, I wouldn't think in a million years that I could write a
book or a song--I wouldn't have the confidence. But because I've
got up onstage and performed in front of so many people and
they've bought my album, it gives me this confidence to try
anything. Perhaps it's delusions of grandeur, or delusions of
adequacy. But I've got this brilliant thing where I go, &quot;I'm
Robbie Williams,&quot; and people are interested in what I want
to say--which is amazing because I'm just an idiot from
Stoke-on-Trent. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Well,
what do you want to say? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I don't
really know. I want to wake up in the morning and be able to go
and buy five pairs of sneakers, and to be able to eat sushi
whenever I want to, and to treat my mother to a car every now and
again. But that's not saying anything--that's doing. I think I
want to do things more than say things. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: You're
very self-deprecating about your talents as a musician, but
people are now more than ever interested in what you're doing,
even those who despised Take That. Were the critical hammerings
of Take That fuel for your fire? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Yeah,
basically. I'm not a boy-band member. I never was. I didn't know
what I could do or who I was creatively, but I knew it wasn't
being a part of a boy band. I know what my friends think of boy
bands and that's exactly what I think of them--and I was in one.
It was pretty embarrassing. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: How did
you break out of that? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: They
sacked me and then I took a lot of drugs. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: But how
did you turn around people's perceptions of you, form being a
boy-band member to who you are now? <br>
<br>
</font><font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I've
done something honestly, somehting with sincerity, and I think
I've done something that has a lot of entertainment value. I
think that's what people want now. How long that will last, I
don't know. But while I'm here I'm going to have a good time. I
don't know how I changed people's perceptions; I wrote some good
songs I think. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Were
you not able to in Take That? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Take
That was a divide-and-conquer situation with a certain member of
the band and the manager. It was definitely a setup for a solo
career other than mine, and anything that got in the way or
showed any bit of talent was swept under the carpet. that was
pretty suppressive, so I didn't bother until I left the band. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: You're
talking about Gary Barlow. <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Yeah <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Is
there still animosity between the two of you? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I think
the animosity now is: I hate him because of what he stands for
and what he used to be when I knew him, and he hates me because
I've sold millions more records than he has. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Not too
many people have come out of a teenybop band situation and made
it big. Are there any people who've made that leap before whom
you admire? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I
admire George Michael. I think he's the only one, really. He's
had a fantastic career. I'd like his career. I'm not really into
his music, I like some of it, but him as a person--and his
career--I admire a lot. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Tell me
about life in Stoke-on-Trent. What was it like to grow up there? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: It's
like bum-f*** anywhere else in America. It's a very industrial
town. We were a town raised on the pottery industry. There're a
lot of coal mines there, and that all feel flat on its face, so
it's a very broke town. My father's a comedian. My mother was a
business lady, and she's a drug and alcohol counselor now,
funnily enough. So I was raised with my father's entertainment
side. I didn't take any of my mother's business sense with me,
that's for sure, with all the money I've lost. But growing up as
a kid, I played soccer, sang, did theater stuff, went to school,
was an average student. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: What
did you think you'd be doing back then? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Exactly
this. Not sitting at a hotel pool in L.A. talking to you on the
phone--I didn't know that was going to happen. But when me
grandmother said to me, &quot;What you gonna do when you get
older?&quot; I said, &quot;Nana, I don't know how it's gonna
happen, but by the time I'm twenty-one, I'm gonna be
internationally famous and I'm gonna be a millionaire.&quot; So I
had a bit of faith. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Did you
always have confidence in yourself? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: No, I'm
as insecure and neurotic as everybody else. I don't think it was
confidence; it was just a feeling. I don't think I was any good
at anything, but I knew that I was gonna be famous and I was
gonna earn money. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: You
have a very camp sensibility. What draws you to that? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I think
any entertainer you look at, even the butch entertainers, are
camp. If you're an entertainer, and you use your hands when you
sing, you're camp. And I like that, I like camping around. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: All
artists pick up on what other artists are doing or have done.
Which artists play into your particular image? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Frank
Sinatra, Dean Martin, Gene Kelly, Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Bette
Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Tom Jones, the Beatles,
Michael Caine, Chuck D. All the greats. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: I saw a
video clip of your duet with Tom Jones. It was quite a hoot. <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: It
was--working with an old pro. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Was it
spontaneous? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Yeah!
Tom Jones has got my favorite voice, and I knew he was going to
blow me away onstage for singing, so I just thought, Well, I
better dance well. And I think I did. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Is it
all by the seat of your pants? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I'm
white-knuckling it all the way. I just feel the fear and throw
myself at it. I haven't got a f***ing clue. I just keep writing
songs and singing them. There's no set plan. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Do you
think what you're doing will translate to American audiences? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I don't
know. The way I look at is like this: I have had the best time in
my life in the last seven days, the best time since I've been
famous. Because nobody's known who I am, it's been really
relaxing, and apart from the fact if I want to get laid that's
pretty difficult because nobody's knowing who I am, I've really
enjoyed having that anonymity. So if it doesn't happen here, then
I've still got a holiday place to come to, and if it does happen
here, I'll have enough money to go to the moon. I'm a quote a
minute, aren't I? Oh, I got a tattoo! I've got one on my left
arm, which is a Maori prayer from New Zealand that protects me
from myself, and I went to Sunset Strip opposite the Viper Room
last night and got a lion tattooed on my arm. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Why a
lion? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW:
Protection. And I've got a Celtic cross on my leg as well, and
that's protection. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Why do
you need to be protected? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Because
I've got the devil in me. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Why are
you afraid of yourself? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I don't
know if it's abnormal, or if it's just what twenty-five-year-olds
feel right now, but I can't trust myself. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: Are you
talking about substance-abuse problems? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW:
Substance abuse. Drinking. Sex. Or throwing myself off balconies.
You know, just the normal stuff. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: I
understand you got engaged this past year to Nicole Appleton of
All Saints. <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Yeah. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: How
much would a photo of the two of you go for? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Well,
we're not going out with each other anymore. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: I'm
sorry to hear that. <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: Yeah,
me too. It's one of those things. When you're twenty-five,
commitment's a miracle. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: What
happened? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I'm as
fickle as anyone my age, I think. People want security from me
and I'm not of a right mind to give it at the minute, especially
in the world I live in. <br>
<br>
</font>RR: When
you accepted your MTV Europe award, you just said, &quot;Damn
right, too,&quot; and walked off. Why? <br>
<br>
<font color="#55cb1d" size="3" face="arial narrow">RW: I was
very scared. I was very emotional. My mother was in the audience.
I'm always very cocky and I've always got something to say, but I
had nothing to say that night. I was so overwhelmed and I
thought, If I start thanking people I'm going to cry, so I'll say
something really cocky and walk off. It was the first time in my
life that I was actually speechless. <br>
