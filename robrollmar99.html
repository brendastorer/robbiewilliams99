America,
meet Robbie Williams, the one-man Rat Pack. The English singer
got started in Take That, a Brit 'N Sync of sorts, before he
split, did it his way and achieved U.K. pop domination. Robbie
previewed his first U.S. album, <i>The Ego Has Landed</i>, in New
York and L.A., showing off his Elton John-esque voice and cheeky
wit. But first he watched some telly. &quot;There was a Rat Pack
documentary on A&amp;E,&quot; he says. &quot;I was jealous of
Peter Lawford. F***in' hell, I could be him. I'd have licked
Sinatra's ass, gotten right in there and been funnier than
Lawford. If only I was born sixty years ago.&quot; <br>
